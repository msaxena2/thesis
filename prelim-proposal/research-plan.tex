\section{Research Plan}

In this section, we discuss challenges we plan to address through this work.

\paragraph{Systematic Generation of Visual Program Represenations}

Extremely vital to the success of \MediK{}, the the ability
to generate visual representation of \MediK{} programs to aid
comprehensibility to medical domain experts, enabling them to verify
accuracy of encoded medical knowledge. Even though \MediK{} code
structurally resembles paper-based guidelines, pictorial
representation can futher improve comprhensibility as medical
domain experts are already familiar with the paper-based counterparts.

The visual representations that we plan to generate utilize
as their basis the program's control flow graph (\CFG).
While generating \CFGs{} might seem like a simple task,
there does not actually exists a \emph{canonical} understanding of
what \CFGs{} are. In \cite{KoppelICFP22}, the authors
illustrate this by using three different \CFG{} generators
on the same program, and obtaining three different \CFGs{}, each
tailored to the objectives of the generator.


%But, despite use in tools such as compilers and model checkers,
%there does not exist a \emph{canonical} definition of what CFGs are.
%For example, in \cite{KoppelICFP22}, the authors demonstrates such descrepancies by
%using running different CFG tools on the same code, each resulting in different
%results, to suit specific applications.




%Some, such as \emph{performance improvements}
%for execution and analysis, are not specific to \MediK{}, but vital
%nevertheless. Others, such as \emph{enhancing comprehensibility} of programs
%to non-experts in Computer Science by enabling visual program summaries that only
%present \emph{relevant semantic information} is very benefecial in
%\MediK-centric settings.


%Semantics-based compilation can be considered a generalization of
%established techniques for established techniques for program optimization
%such as partial evaluation of programs \cite{Jones93Book}.
%
%For a given language $L$, let $\llbracket\_\rrbracket_{L}$ be the
%intepreter for L. Say, for given $p \in L$--$\text{Program}$, and inputs
%$\text{in}_1, \text{in}_2$,
%$\text{output} = \llbracket p \rrbracket_{L}\left[\text{in}_1,\text{in}_2\right]$
%if $p$ terminates.
%We can now express partial evaluation of program p, using another
%program $\mix$, called so since performs a mix of both execution and code
%generation as follows:
%  $$\llbracket \llbracket \mix \rrbracket \left[p, \text{in}_1\right] \rrbracket
%  \left[\text{in}_2\right]
%  = \llbracket p \rrbracket \left[\text{in}_1, \text{in}_2\right]$$
%Now, for given program $p$, if $\text{in}_1$ is statically known (at stage 1),
%and $\text{in}_2$ is dynamically known (at stage 2), then, executing the
%entire program in one stage as:
%$$ \llbracket p \rrbracket \left[\text{in}_1, \text{in}_2\right] $$ can be more
%expensive than computing partially evaluating $p$ on $\text{in}_1$,
%i.e. $p_{\text{in}_1} = \llbracket p \rrbracket \left [ \text{in}_1 \right]$ and
%re-utilizing it for phase 2, i.e.
%$\llbracket p \rrbracket \left [\text{in}_1, \text{in}_2 \right] = \llbracket
%p_{\text{in}_1} \rrbracket \left [ \text{in}_2 \right]$
%

%Our experience of implementing pediatric sepsis management in \MediK{}
%revealed the importance of \emph{visual representations} to improve
%comprehensibility of \MediK{} programs to medical domain experts.
%\MediK{} programs structurally resemble flowhcharts by design, but
%if visualized, they resemble existing \BPGs{} found in medical
%literature that \HCPs{} are already familiar with.
%
%We plan to utilize a technique called semantics-based compilation (SBC) to generate
%visual representations.
