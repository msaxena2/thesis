In this section, we discuss challenges we plan to address through this work.

\subsection{Generation of Visual Representations of \MediK{} Programs}

Our experience of implementing pediatric sepsis management in \MediK{}
revealed the importance of \emph{visual representations} to improve
comprehensibility of \MediK{} programs to medical domain experts.
\MediK{} programs structurally resemble flowhcharts by design, but
if visualized, they resemble existing \BPGs{} found in medical
literature that \HCPs{} are already familiar with.

To achieve this, we plan to utilize \emph{semantics-based compilation}.
Our approach
