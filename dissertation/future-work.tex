of our system.

\section{Soundness of Model Checking Abstraction}\label{sec:abstraction-soundness}

In \autoref{sec:formal-analysis}, we introduced an abstraction that enabled us
to model check the system. Instead of interpreting $\MediK{}$ programs
concretely, we introduced rules that operate over abstract values
that hold semantic meaning. However, we did not establish that the analysis is
indeed sound. In this section, we briefly outline the steps to prove the
soundness of our abstraction-based analysis, and outline limitations that
prevented us from establishing it.

Recall that in \autoref{sec:theoretical-foundations}
