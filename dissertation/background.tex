\chapter{Background}

This chapter introduces relevant background information on
best practice guidelines (\BPG{}) and guidelines-based clinical decision support
systems (\CDSS{}).
In section \ref{sec:bpg-background}, we utilize a real-world \BPG{}
to explain the motivation behind codifying treatment
in the form of clinical guidelines. We also briefly discuss
common characteristics of such guidelines that enable medical knowledge
to be represented efficiently and accurately.

\BPGs{} are usually published by hospitals,
research institutions and medical associations with the aim to improve quality of care by
\begin{enumerate*}[label=(\alph*)]
  \item reducing medical errors due to preventable causes,
  \item standardizing knowledge from latest evidence-based research, and,
  \item enabling access to aforementioned knowledge at medical establishments
  that lack resources to conduct research.
\end{enumerate*}

While in theory, following \BPGs{} should improve clinical outcomes,
their effectiveness in practice is dictated by whether healthcare practitioners
follow them or not. In section \ref{sec:cdss-background}, we present
challenges that practitioners encounter in following \BPGs{}. We then argue
that non-conformance results in worse patient outcomes.
Next, we show how computerized systems that utilize data from available
heterogeneous sources such as electronic health records and sensors for
patient parameters can improve patient outcomes by addressing challenges
to following \BPGs{} encountered by practitioners.
